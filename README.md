# Image classification in the browser

This is a simple CNN for image classification, trained in a Colab notebook then imported onto this website. The classifier can be used to recognize three Columbia University landmarks from one another: the Alma Mater statue, the Marteleur statue, and the "Curl" sculpture. 

The classifier can be accessed [here](https://corentinllorca.github.io/)
